   Smart Online Service — site configuration
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT for prices, services, reviews,
   contact details and coming-soon cards. No build step — save and refresh.

   Rules of thumb:
     • Keep the quotes " " around text and the commas at line ends.
     • Prices are text, so you can write "₹349*" or "₹1,299" freely.
     • `original` is the struck-through price; the "% OFF" pill is worked
       out automatically from original vs price.
